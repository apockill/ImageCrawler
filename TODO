Alex:
    - Save a log that contains a plaintext list of where images were found, so James can run it through Stillio.com to
      get the full screenshots
    - Figure out why sometimes openCV throws an error...
    - Add Websites list to GUI
    - End Scan button?

Tyler:
    - When crawler.get_image() is called, it should return the image, and the URL of the page that the image was embedded
      into. This way on alex's end, the image
    - Add some kind of crawler.progress that returns a number between 0 and 100, reflecting a guesstimate of the progress
      Doesn't have to be too accurate.
    - Could you make an icon (.ico) so the program can have a cool-guy executable? :D
    - Check out the bug below?

ERROR 3 (Alex):
cv2.error: C:\OpenCV3\Sources\modules\imgcodecs\src\loadsave.cpp:490: error: (-215) !buf.empty() && buf.isContinuous() in function cv::imdecode_
    - Hold off until error 1 is solved, maybe won't be a problem anymore (?)
